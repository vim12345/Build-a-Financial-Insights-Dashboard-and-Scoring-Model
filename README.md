### Title: Build a Financial Insights Dashboard and Scoring Model
# Assignment Brief
# 1. Data Analysis:
• Analyze the dataset to:

• Identify family-level and member-level spending patterns.

• Understand correlations between financial metrics (e.g., income vs expenses, savings vs. spending habits).
# 2. Build a Financial Scoring Model:
• Develop a scoring mechanism (range: 0–100) to evaluate each family's financial
health.

• Factors to include:

• Savings-to-Income Ratio.

• Monthly Expenses as a percentage of Income.

• Loan Payments as a percentage of Income.

• Credit Card Spending trends.

• Spending category distribution (e.g., higher travel/entertainment
spending lowers the score).

• Financial Goals Met (%).

• Provide a justification for the scoring logic and weights assigned to each
factor

# 3. Insights Visualization:
• Use Python with Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to visualize:

• Spending distribution across categories.

• Family-wise financial scores.

• Member-wise spending trends.

• Include at least 3 meaningful visualizations.

# 4. Deploy the Model:

• Use Flask or FastAPI to expose the scoring model as an API.

• Input: Family-level and transaction data for a family.

• Output: Financial score and key insights (e.g., "Savings are below recommended levels, which affects your score by X points").
# Bonus Tasks:
1. Implement a simple Streamlit or Dash app to allow interaction with the scoring model
and visualizations.

2. Provide recommendations for improving financial scores (e.g., "Reduce discretionary
spending by 10% to improve your score by X points").
# Deliverables:
• Python Code:
• Include a Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts with:
• Data cleaning and preprocessing logic.
• Scoring model implementation and evaluation.
• Visualizations.
• API:
• Deploy a Flask/FastAPI app for testing the model.
• Documentation:
• README with setup instructions and explanation of model logic.
